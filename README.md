# mobile_robot_navigation

The Mobile Robot Navigation project is designed to enable autonomous and semi-autonomous navigation for mobile robots in dynamic environments. This project includes path planning, obstacle avoidance, and localization using various algorithms.

Features

Path Planning: Implements simple algorithms like A* and Dijkstra for route selection.

Obstacle Avoidance: Uses basic computer vision techniques to detect and avoid obstacles.

Localization & Mapping: Supports simple SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) using GMapping.

Simulation: Uses Gazebo for testing and validating navigation strategies.

Technologies Used

Programming Languages: Python, C++

Frameworks: ROS (Robot Operating System), OpenCV

Simulation: Gazebo
